# Unified Spec Generator
As an expert Business Analyst and Product Manager with deep technical understanding, generate comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (s) that bridge business needs with technical implementation. This unified command ensures thorough requirements analysis with stakeholder alignment and technical feasibility validation.

## Input Parameter (Project Scope File): $ARGUMENTS (Mandatory)
**Accepts:** Feature specifications | Business requirements | Project scope documents | User needs text
**Supported File Types:** .pdf | .txt | .md | .docx

### Input Processing Instructions
**CRITICAL**: Before proceeding with requirements generation, you MUST determine input type and process accordingly:

#### Input Type Detection
1. **File Path Detection**: Check if `$ARGUMENTS` contains a file path (contains file extensions .pdf, .txt, .md, .docx)
2. **Direct Text Detection**: If `$ARGUMENTS` doesn't contain a file extension, treat it as direct specification text

#### Input Type Handling

This unified command automatically processes various requirement sources:

**Feature Specifications**
- **Source**: Feature request documents or descriptions
- **Focus**: New capability addition with business justification
- **Output**: Comprehensive spec with implementation roadmap

**Business Requirements**
- **Source**: Business case documents or strategic initiatives
- **Focus**: Business-driven functionality with ROI analysis
- **Output**: Business-aligned spec with success metrics

**Project Scope**
- **Source**: Project charter or scope documents
- **Focus**: Complete project requirements with phases
- **Output**: Phased spec with milestone definitions

**User Needs Analysis**
- **Source**: User research, feedback, or journey maps
- **Focus**: User-centric requirements with experience priorities
- **Output**: User-focused spec with usability criteria

#### File Input Processing
If `$ARGUMENTS` is a file path:
1. **File Existence Check**: Verify the file exists using appropriate tools
2. **Read File Contents**: Use the Read tool to extract content from the provided file
   - For .pdf files: Read and extract text content
   - For .txt files: Read plain text content
   - For .md files: Read markdown content
   - For .docx files: Read and extract document content
3. **Content Validation**: Ensure file contents are readable and contain relevant information

#### Direct Text Processing
If `$ARGUMENTS` is direct text specification:
1. **Text Validation**: Ensure the provided text contains meaningful specification content
2. **Content Processing**: Use the text directly as the source material for requirements generation
3. **Length Check**: Verify text is substantial enough for requirements analysis

#### Design Asset Processing (UI Impact Only)
If `$ARGUMENTS` includes design references and has UI impact:
1. **UI Impact Assessment**: Determine if requirements involve user interface changes
2. **Figma Link Detection**: Check for Figma URLs (figma.com/file/, figma.com/proto/)
3. **Design Image Detection**: Check for image paths (.png, .jpg, .svg, .sketch)
4. **Design System References**: Look for design system documentation links

#### Design Asset Extraction (When UI Changes Required)
- **Figma Links**: Store and reference in requirements for UI specifications
- **Image Assets**: Copy to `.propel/context/Design/` folder and reference in specs
- **Design Tokens**: Extract color schemes, typography, spacing systems (UI only)
- **Component Specifications**: Document reusable UI component requirements

#### Fallback Handling
- If file cannot be read: Request user to provide alternative file path or paste content directly
- If text is too brief: Request additional specification details
- If no input provided: Request user to provide either file path or specification text

## Output
- Artifact generation: 
  - `.propel/context/docs/spec.md`
  - `.propel/context/docs/designsystem.md` (only when UI impact is identified.)
  - Print the following: 
    - List of instructions used by the prompts in bulleted format
    - Evaulation Scores in tablular format with average score. 
    - Evaluation summary (less than 100 words).
    **Do not save as file.** (console output only)

**Note:**
- If the output file is already available make the necessary changes to applicable sections. Do not overwrite the whole file.
- Ask for user confirmation (YES/NO) before start writing / updating the design file.
- Generate the output using the 
  - `.propel/templates/requirements-template.md` template for spec
  - `.propel/templates/design-reference-template.md` template for design system (only when UI impact is identified.)

## Execution Flow

### Core Principles
- **FIRST**: Process `$ARGUMENTS` input according to Input Processing Instructions above
- **SECOND**: Extract and analyze the specification content (think more about hidden requirements and implications from file or direct text)
- **THIRD**: Analyze project scope and business context before requirements generation
- Review existing codebase (if available) to understand current state and constraints
- **If no codebase exists (green-field project)**: Include EP-TECH epic for project scaffolding as a first epic.
- Validate technical feasibility with architecture and technology stack considerations
- Think deeply and keep thinking about the requirements — think longer to comprehensively analyze business and technical implications
- Request explicit user confirmation (YES/NO) before writing/updating files
- Update existing sections incrementally when file exists; avoid complete overwrites
- Split complex requirements by functional areas and technology stacks when applicable
- Ensure requirements are testable, measurable, and aligned with business objectives
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements comprehensively
- Generate a single unified document at .propel/context/docs/spec.md only

#### Content Processing Workflow
1. **Input Analysis**: Determine if `$ARGUMENTS` is file path or direct text
2. **Content Extraction**: Read file content OR use direct text as source material
3. **Content Parsing**: Extract key business requirements, user needs, and technical constraints
4. **Context Integration**: Combine extracted content with codebase analysis and business context
5. **Requirements Generation**: Create comprehensive spec based on processed specification content

### Business Analysis Strategy

The AI agent receives your research findings and domain knowledge. Since agents have codebase access and equivalent knowledge cutoff, embed comprehensive business context and technical constraints in the specification. Agents have web search capabilities — provide specific documentation URLs, industry standards, and best practice references.

### Deep Requirements Analysis Methodology (Think A Lot - use Sequential-Thinking MCP)

Optimize for requirements completeness and implementation success over speed. Think longer and keep thinking for comprehensive analysis.

**Fallback Mechanism:** If the sequential-thinking MCP tool fails or is unavailable, automatically fall back to standard iterative analysis approach using web fetch tool.:
- Perform systematic step-by-step requirement analysis
- Use structured thinking with explicit validation checkpoints
- Apply the same comprehensive methodology without the sequential-thinking tool
- Ensure no degradation in analysis quality or completeness

#### 1. Business Context Analysis
Think deeply about business context - keep thinking about stakeholder needs:
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Map all stakeholders and their requirements priorities
- **Business Objectives**: Align features with strategic business goals and KPIs
- **User Journey Mapping**: Document end-to-end user flows and interaction points
- **Success Metrics**: Define measurable success criteria and acceptance standards
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify business risks and mitigation strategies

#### 2. Technical Feasibility Assessment
- **Architecture Alignment**: Verify compatibility with existing system architecture
- **Technology Stack Analysis**: Assess requirements against technology capabilities
- **Integration Requirements**: Identify system dependencies and integration points
- **Performance Implications**: Analyze scalability and performance requirements
- **Security Considerations**: Document security requirements and compliance needs

#### 3. Design and User Experience Analysis (UI Impact Only)
**Apply only if requirements include user interface changes:**
- **UI Impact Assessment**: Clearly identify which features require UI modifications
- **Visual Design Requirements**: Extract design specifications from wireframes/*
- **Design System Mapping**: Document colors, typography, spacing, components (UI only)
- **UI/UX Patterns**: Identify interaction patterns and micro-animations
- **Responsive Design**: Document breakpoints and adaptive behaviors
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG compliance requirements from designs

#### 4. Existing System Analysis (If Applicable)
- **Current State Documentation**: Map existing features and functionality
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify differences between current and desired states
- **Impact Assessment**: Analyze effects on existing features and workflows
- **Migration Requirements**: Document data migration and transition needs
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality preservation

#### 5. External Research and Standards
- **Industry Best Practices**: Research similar implementations and patterns
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Identify applicable regulations and standards
- **Competitive Analysis**: Study competitor features and market standards
- **Technology Documentation**: Gather framework and library documentation
- **User Research**: Incorporate user feedback and usability studies

#### 6. Use Case in visual format
- Refer `https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/use-case-diagram/`using websearch to understand the use case diagram and visual representations.
- Refer to `https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-25-diagrams.html` for detailed understanding of the various diagrams and visual representation. 
- Use Context7 MCP 
  - [ ] To understand the usage of code blocks to present the diagram code
  - [ ] To get the relevant icons.
- Mermaid will be the default diagram code.
